This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

# Your Task - Star Wars Navigation System
There is no one who does not know the **Star Wars** universe. If, however, it has survived - it better be hidden. In Flip - we definitely stand on the **Light Side of the Force**.
To prove your strength and join the **Jedi Flip Council**, you must pass a test task that tests your experience, cunning and determination.
The final test is ahead of you. Make fresh coffee, put on your favorite slippers and get ready for the adventure of a lifetime.

Your task is to write an Application thanks to which **Stormtroopers** will be able to navigate between solar systems.
You can use our top secret **Jedi Flip Council Archives** for this task.
